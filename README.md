# Welcome to the RhythmiRust-Wiki Repository!

Thank you for visiting the **RhythmiRust-Wiki** repository! This project is dedicated to providing a comprehensive wiki for RhythmiRust.

## Overview

This repository contains:
- A [Python script](./wiki_compiler.py) that converts ODG (Open Document Graphics) files into PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format and copies other files to generate the final wiki directory. **Note:** The wiki compiler requires [**LibreOffice**](https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/who-are-we) as it uses it to convert the ODG files.
- JSON files that store wiki pages/layouts, which my program uses to render content into wiki pages.
- Images referenced in the JSON files, allowing the wiki to display them appropriately within the rendered pages.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! If you find an area that could be improved—whether it's rewording a section for clarity, expanding on a topic, or adding new content—please feel free to edit and enhance the wiki. Your contributions will help create a richer resource for all users.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RhythmiRust-Wiki:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore [**_Wiki_build_helper.json**](./_Wiki_build_helper.json) to see example building blocks of the wiki.
3. Copy/Reference from [**_Wiki_build_helper.json**](./_Wiki_build_helper.json) and design the page as you see fit.

## How to Use

- Run the Python script to generate the final wiki directory. This directory can be placed in the **RhythmiRust_config** folder and should be rendered once in place.
